### What are roles?

Each actor has a role. The roles are determined by the selected scenario. For now, the product only has 'All Night At The Lake With You' as a scenario, which according to our data was one of the most frequently watched human-generated shows around life and death counting by unique data points (views).

How are roles activated during the stream? As machines, a role's subroutines are automatically programmed by the software, so you do not have to do anything other than communicating further instructions to them via the User Iterface (UI).

Script 1: 'All Night At The Lake With You' by Hans Grier (2021).
---

The script is about a _vampire Singer_ named Aksel Oriana, a _grave digger Clown_ named Evelin Gregor, a _farmer Writer_ named Rosalva Nisha and a _Media Producer and Slayer_ named Laius gildo who are busy surviving a foreign land bordered by nothingness and a Martian parasite that turns inactive biological organisms into food-seeking predator organisms also known as 'zombie' in Common Human Language (CHL). In other words, the story is about eccentric people fighting off hordes of zombies and philosophizing about life and death.

There are four main actors in this script:

### Aksel Oriana

***Setup***

***Role***

* Aksel's role is to prey on other actors in the stream and he will also cull the artificially generated human NPCs.
	* Aksel will only prey on other actors if you, the Host, decided on a target, or
	* An actor's health is sufficiently low (the scent of blood activates this actor's subroutine).

### Evelin Gregor

***Role***

* Laius Gildo will seek and destroy predators in any quadrants.
	* He needs 'food' to replenish himself and to continue doing his role
	* Laius's role is the only one capable of killing Aksel Oriana, the vampire role archetype
