### The Vampire

1. setup
    1. Vampires are only active at night (in-game stream time).

2. Job

    1. A vampire's role (job) is to prey on other actors in your stream and also to cull the artificially generated humans in-game.
	    1. They will only prey other actors if you, the Host, decided on a target, or
	    2. An actor's health is sufficiently low (the scent of blood activates this subroutine).
